Modern engines are also referred to as internal combustion engines; they work by heating and combusting fuel inside to move your vehicle by powering pistons. The main outer portion of the engine is called the engine block, it is a large structure with large cylinders where the pistons can move inside as the engine is powered. Cylinders, and other passages built into the engine, allow coolant to flow, which in turn, cools the engine as it works.", "ENGINE_REPAIR", 5),

It not only cools it down, but also reduces the moisture content, or humidity. All air conditioners work the same way whether they are installed in a building, or in a car. The fridge or freezer is in a way an air conditioner as well.

As vehicles have become heavier and switched to front wheel drive, particularly using negative offset geometry, along with increases in tire width and diameter, the effort needed to turn the wheels about their steering axis has increased, often to the point where major physical exertion would be needed were it not for power assistance.", "POWER_STEERING_SYSTEM", 4);
